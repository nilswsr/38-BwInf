# 38. Bundeswettbewerb Informatik

The "Bundeswettbewerb Informatik" is an annual competition between German students.  
The main topics are exploring/developing algorithms, adapting them to a specific task and finally implementing and documenting them.

## What I have learned
- Path-Finding Algorithms (A* Pathfinding, Dijkstra, ...)
- Theoretical Analysis of Algorithms (Time & Space Complexity)
- Documenting projects for externals to understand them
